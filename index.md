I am a PhD student working at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute ([IIIA-CSIC](https://www.iiia.csic.es/)) and the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona under the supervision of [Marco Schorlemmer] (http://www.iiia.csic.es/~marco/Bio.html). I work on the general area of multi-agent communication. More concretly, I am interested in the problem of vocabulary alignment between heterogeneous agents in task-oriented interactions, and my goal is to develop learning techniques that improve mutual understanding by using only the information in the specification of an interaction.

I am part of the [ESSENCE](https://www.essence-network.com/) Marie Curie Initial Training Network, that brings together PhD students working on different aspects of semantic evolution in artificial systems. I spent some time working in other parter institutions, such as the [CISA](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cisa) group at the University of Edinburgh. 

Before starting my doctoral studies, I received a Computer Science *licenciatura* (in general, equivalent to a MSc degree) from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. During my last year I spent three months as an intern at INRIA-LORIA in Nancy, France, where I conducted the research for my final thesis *A study of the Combination Problem: dealing with multiple theories in SMT solving* ([PDF](https://www.dc.uba.ar/inv/tesis/licenciatura/2014/chocron.pdf)).
